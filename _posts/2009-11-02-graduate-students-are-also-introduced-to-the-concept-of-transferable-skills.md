Just got an email about a workshop for grad students called &#8220;Convert your CV into a Resume.&#8221; Besides the fact that universities should be offering more than workshops to prepare [the vast majority of grad students who won&#8217;t be securing a coveted tenure position][1], the description seems to reflect so many of the problems with the current system.

> Interested in pursuing a career in consulting, government, non-profit, policy, finance, academic/student affairs or &#8220;industry&#8221; in general? Well you will need a concise and dynamic resume and cover letter to peak[sic] any companies&#8217; or institutions&#8217; interest enough to call you for an interview&#8211;and résumés often differ drastically from CVs.  This workshop introduces graduate students to the basic but essential strategies and tips for converting a CV into an effective resume. Graduate students are also introduced to the concept of &#8220;transferable skills&#8221; and given the latest information regarding current industry needs and resume styles.

C&#8217;mon academia, grad students are going to need a lot more than a workshop on the latest &#8220;resume styles&#8221; to land safely after getting kicked out the window of the 92nd floor of the Ivory Tower.
