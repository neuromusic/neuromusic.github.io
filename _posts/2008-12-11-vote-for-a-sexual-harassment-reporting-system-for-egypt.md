I&#8217;m working with two cool organizations&#8230; <a href="http://nijel.org" target="_blank">NiJeL</a> and the <a href="http://ecwronline.org" target="_blank">Egyptian Center for Women&#8217;s Rights</a> to launch a sexual harassment reporting system for Egypt. It will allow women to anonymously report sexual harassment via SMS and have their report show up on a map. The system will help increase protection in hot areas, and demonstrate to officials the need for a new law and enforcement to protect women.

Read the proposal and vote here:

### Why is this important?

Well, see for yourself&#8230;



### There are a few simple rules to voting:

*   If you don’t have a NetSquared account yet, register for one at: **<https://www.netsquared.org/user/register>** (please check your junk mail folder if you do not see a registration email confirmation)
*   You can only vote for each project once
*   Each registered user has one (1) ballot
*   You must vote for at least three (3) projects and no more than five (5)
*   All votes are weighted equally (in other words, your first choice and fifth choice have equal value)

### Other cool projects

Since you will have to vote for three projects, I&#8217;d like to point you in the direction a few other cool projects which are worthy of your attention, one by NiJeL and one which is complementary to our efforts in harassment reporting:

*   **[FloodSMS &#8211; Early Detection and Warning of Catastrophic Flooding via SMS][1]** 
    This project, a joint effort between [NiJeL][2] and **[ekgaon technologies][3]**, will create a flood early warning application, which will push SMS messages to people downstream of a flood event giving them up to 24 hours advanced warning. We intend to pilot this project in the Terai region of Nepal-India.</li> 
    *   **[Message Sent: رسالة, Improving Basic Cell Phone Literacy in Egyptian Women][4]** 
        Building on a broad-based adult literacy program in Egypt, the “Message Sent” project will demonstrate the efficacy of simple mobile phones in attracting new adults (80% women), motivating active learning in class and at home, and increasing sustainable use of text messaging and calculations.</li> 
        *   **[Ushahidi V2 &#8211; Mobile.Crisis.Reporting][5]** 
            The Ushahidi Engine is a platform that allows anyone to gather distributed data via SMS, email or web and visualize it on a map or timeline. Their goal is to create the simplest way of aggregating information from the public for use in crisis response. This project seeks to expand the mobile component of Ushahidi.</li> </ul> 
            Thanks for voting!!
