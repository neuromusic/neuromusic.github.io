A quick thought, [inspired on twitter][1]:

Money is protected as &#8220;free speech&#8221;, hence lobbying is legal. We can give money to other persons to speak for us.

Could we nail down the &#8220;value&#8221; of protesting? That is, what is the amount of money I would need to donate to my cause such that I could stay home and sit on my couch instead of protesting?

If we have a given bill (say to tighten gun controls), lets say that the pro-gun folks dedicated $100 Million against and had 1000 protestors outside of congress, while the anti-gun folks rummaged up only $1 Million, but got 100,000 protestors.

For simplicity, lets say that the vote is a tie, meaning that both sides were equally effective.

We could then just solve for x, where x is the value of a single protestor…

100,000,000 + (x \* 1000) = 1,000,000 + (x \* 100,000)  
999,000,000 = x * 99,000  
x = $10,091

… which sounds very high to me (made up numbers, of course).

Analyzed across, say, all of the bills before congress during a given session, though, one could perhaps get an estimate of the value of protesting.

Hmm&#8230; surely a political economist has done this?
