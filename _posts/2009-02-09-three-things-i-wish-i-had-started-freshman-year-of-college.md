*I initially compiled this list while I was applying for grad schools. It was just a quick email that I sent to a list of other [Flinn scholars][1], hoping that it could be a few words of wisdom for the new ones. Here it is:*

I wish I had&#8230;

### 1. started signing up for frequent flyer miles

I don&#8217;t know how many miles I&#8217;ve flown during my undergrad. maybe a bazillion. study abroad. conferences. visiting friends and family. I should have signed up for a frequent flyer program. Since I did a lot of international flying, it would have been best to go with one (or all) of the alliances&#8230; like <a href="http://www.oneworld.com/" target="_blank">oneworld</a>, <a href="http://www.skyteam.com/" target="_blank">SkyTeam</a> or <a href="http://www.staralliance.com/" target="_blank">Star Alliance</a>&#8230; or I could have tried to get a credit card that gave frequent flier miles. Whatever way, I wish I could now cash these in to visit friends and grad schools, etc.

### 2. saved all of my course syllabi in a single file

One of the grad schools I applied to wanted me to organize my *entire* transcript (all 210+ credit hours of it) based on courses which were most relevant to the program ***including the textbook used for each course***. Technically, I save most of my syllabi because I am (was?) a major pack-rat. But I saved them along with every other unimportant scrap of paper I got from those classes. So when I decided it was time to purge myself of the many boxes of junk from the prior 5.5 years of my college career, I think I discarded most of them. Which made determining the textbook used for the CHM115 course I took in the spring of &#8217;03 exceedingly difficult. The course was not on Blackboard at the time and the instructor had since pulled the info from his own website. The <a href="http://archive.org/" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a> didn&#8217;t even help, since it doesn&#8217;t archive PDF files. I wish I had had a single file to go to to see all of my syllabi.

### 3. actually started a portfolio

because, again, one of my grad school prospects specifically asked for this. and they want it on the internet. I think this is especially true advice for &#8220;project&#8221; majors&#8211;that is, majors where you learn to develop a project with a final result. Art, composition, design, engineering, computer science. The tough part I found when I kindof started freshman year is being able to guess what is relevant. But the cool thing I&#8217;ve realized is that it is likely all relevant. Don&#8217;t know where to start? Try putting this into google&#8230; &#8220;<your field> portfolio&#8221;. Or try to find portfolios of grad students in your field or related fields.
